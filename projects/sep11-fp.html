            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP 11 Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool. For my project, I chose to independently study Phaser in order to help me make a Clicker Game. The purpose of this blog is to explain my web-game and show my thought process and takeaways from making this game.</p>
            <p>For this year's freedom project I decided to make something similar to <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a> which is a clicking game, where you can progress just by clicking. My game which is built from phaser.js as my tool is very similar to cookie clicker because in my game you have to press a button that's located in the middle of the screen to earn points and you can use the points you earn to buy upgrades in the upgrade shop which will increase your multiplier, helping you earn more points faster. I also used a phaser timer function to make sure that the score goes up automatically and you can press the spacebar to press the button as well. </p>
            <p>Some problems I encountered while making my project was that I can't keep the upgrade shop sticked to the right side of the screen and making sure that the button will shrink when you press them and go back to normal when you release your mouse. I solved these problems very fast because I realized you just had to put the upgrades in a container so they can't move out of it and use .setInteractive() from phaser documentation to make the button interactive and then use javascript functions to play animations whenever you click the button. A challenge I encountered while making this game is to learn how to make it so that the game will "auto-click", meaning the score can increase without the user clicking on the screen. This was an important feature to have because it would be repetive if you have to keep clicking the button and you can't afk to grind it. Luckily, I founded my solution on the Phaser documentation. The solution was to use a phaser timer function which is built in already and this helps me control the interval between each increment. So I can make it so that the score will go up automatically every 0.5 seconds. My takeaway was that always try to ask for help or research online when you are stuck because there are so much resources online that can help you, I had to search online to understand how to use the phaser timer function and other people can always help you out. I also learned that it is important to make a plan and have a timeline for yourself because I tried to finish everything towards the end of the year when I can make a lot progress earlier and planning out your project can really help you visualize what you want to do and how you will make it. To further improve this game I think I will try to learn a way to save the data whenever you leave the game because you would have to restart everytime and lose all your progress which can make people quit the game. I will also try to add more design to the game in the future because it looks really bland right now.</p>
