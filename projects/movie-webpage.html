            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>So for this project my main goal is to make a webpage about a movie with my partner (Aymen) through Replit by using the basics of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that I learned from Mr.Mueller's class.</p>
            <p>The movie me and my partner decided to make was horror/mystery related. This ended up with us making a Movie-Webpage about a man named Bob playing a survival game made by a mysterious organization. The movie's name is "The Unknown". Me and my partner each worked on a part of the code and worked together until we fulfilled all the requirements necessary for 100.</p>
            <p>There are a few challenges that I faced during this project, but most of them weren't too hard of a challenge. One of the biggest challenges I faced was trying to do the extra credit, which is to make a sequel for the movie. This is a very big challenge for me because I don't know how to link two HTML pages while using the same CSS, so I went to google for some answers and went to ask my friend. Eventually, I solved my problem and completed my extra credit. Another challenge was applying the "div" element into our code, but I am not sure where to put it so I decided to ask my partner (Aymen) for help. Thankfully he knows what to do so I solved this challenge pretty easily. The last challenge that I had was figuring out the plot and genre of our movie webpage. Me and my partner were both clueless on what to make so we spent a bit of time on trying to think of a plot and character. Due to this project I learned many skills and knowledge in coding and in life. The most important skill I learned from this project was communication because if I have to make the movie webpage I would have to cooperate with my partner and communication would help greatly on setting up or coding the project. I also learned to Google, without this skill I would have been stuck for many parts of my project because I don't know how to use some of the elements in HTML. Thanks to me researching for information on Google, I successfully made my movie webpage a good one. I am glad that I did this project because I learned a lot more about coding through this project. If I had more time I would definitely make the project a better one, I would include better images and write a better plot and make a better design for the project because the design doesn't look that good to me. Anyways, I am grateful to be a part of this project which has helped me learn many important life skills that I would need in my life.</p>
