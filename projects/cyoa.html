            <p>The title of this project is "Life of a Lucky Guy". This is a project that helps us practice collaborarion and linking. For this project, we worked on Github to create this project that helps you experience the life of a lucky person.</p>
            <p>In this project, me and my partner (Ada) used html to create many different files that would be linked together to demonstrate the life of a lucky person. At the start of this project, we made a plan page using google drawing to show our planning when doing the project. Then we just follow the plan and worked together to create the adventure we wanted on the code50IDE. At the end, we used our ideas to create a lucky person's life.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to practice linking and collaboration since we would be using these skills a lot in the future. The biggest take away I had while doing this project is learning how to link files together and learning how to collaborate well. I learned that you can link many file together easily and it is not that hard once you understand, you just have to keep track of the file you are in and make sure you link correctly. The biggest challenge I had while working on this project was coming up with the storyline and communicating because this is my first time working with my partner (Ada) and we couldn't communicate well, but after a bit we were just fine. Then, we have to come up with a storyline but we didn't know what to make since we never experienced a lucky day. We had to continue fixing our plan until we made a perfect one. I think my next step would be adding more storyline and making my website look better since I didn't add a lot of CSS because we were trying to make a MVP. In the future, I would also like to learn and be better at using the IDE for any classwork, project and homework.</p>
